			<h1>Research</h1>
			<div class = "userResearch">
				<h2>User Research</h2>
				<h3>User Interviews</h3>
				<img src="user_interview.JPG" id="interview">
				<p>I found user interviews to be important because they allow me to get new perspectives about my project from people who aren’t close to the it. My interview candidates were colleagues and professionals in the tech field. These are the sort of people that would interact with my portfolio website in the real world. I asked them questions regarding their educational/technical background, goals, their idea of success, and their expectations. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIA_yV1v3C0X8y3pDl7hPu7lX3zrT8PWaFqmIFSve30/edit#gid=1458759859">View the User Interviews.</a></p>

				<h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
				<img src="competitor_analysis.JPG" id="competitor">
				<p>Competitor analysis is the process of identifying your competitors and evaluating their strategies to determine their strengths and weaknesses to those of your own project. When looking for competitors I looked out for people with similar educational backgrounds and in positions that I will be applying to. Lastly I chose competitors whose portfolio I was impressed by. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K1IFHbofjUjW00MB1prhLGOn1s--jyIR9_wuwVssuSo/edit#gid=0">View the Competitor Analysis.</a></p>

				<h3>Feature Value Matrix</h3>
				<img src="feature_value_matrix.JPG" id="value">
				<p> The feature value matrix illustrates the importance placed on specific features pertaining to your project. I selected these features for their aesthetic appeal, functionality, and practicality. The values were assigned according to user value, business value, and developer effort. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/188SpFlGkVXUSdCzzucSmNgEY9pxVhfOff4V-9OHeRKA/edit#gid=2">View the Feature Prioritization.</a></p>

				<h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
				<img src="feature_prioritization.JPG" id="prioritization">
				<p>My strategy for my portfolio website was to create something simple yet elegant. When choosing these features, I had to consider if I had the technical knowledge and time to implement them. I ended up giving high priority to features that were feasible and that added to the core content. After choosing these important features I had a good idea on how to build around them when designing my interface.<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KHyoCCGTUo-Dyd-jV-I6RI4vO-9V1u-O_G13yodpQqA/edit#slide=id.gd46c24b48_0_24">View the Feature Prioritization.</a></p>

				<h2>User Testing</h2>
				<h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
				<img src="cognitive_walkthrough.JPG" id="cognitive">
				<p>A cognitive walkthrough it an evaluation method in which evaluators work through a series of tasks and ask a set of questions from the perspective of the user. Cognitive walkthroughs are important because they allow low cost usability testing to take place with only a prototype and they test the usability of basic functions from the user’s point of view. The challenge for me was getting my evaluators to vocalize their action and provide more feedback. I would ask them follow-up questions to elicit more information. Lastly, the tasks related to the website were very basic and quick which hindered the amount of information I received. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NFNUXeFc4862u5kgrZlqorg_ul2pbpWDmPlJ9-bn39Q/edit#gid=0">View the Cognitive Walkthrough.</a></p>

				<h3>User Stories</h3>
				<img src="user_stories.JPG" id="userstories">
				<p>User stories provide a human factor to otherwise impersonal documentation. They all for a conversation to take place on requirements, features, and functionality. I chose my user stories based on what hiring managers and people in the position I am applying for would look for. These are core elements of my portfolio website yet when describing them in the user stories I was able to get more insight and how the user thinks compared to what I think. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10DkRNAtFM98O_Qx4ok7MT0FPpBzv_O2cqaFyMThNqZs/edit#gid=0">View the User Stories.</a></p>
				

				<h3>User Tests</h3>
				<img src="user_tests.JPG" id="usertest">
				<p>I utilized three user tests. For the first, I had the user click on where they think my resume was located. For the second, I had the user look at the home page for five seconds and describe it. For the third, I had the user click on where they would go to contact me from the home page. I did not face many challenges with the user tests. I chose simple and intuitive tests and received great feedback. Such as, certain elements on the page were thought as being clickable when they weren’t. Furthermore, for my resume click test my position of the link was reinforced as being well placed.  <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/c14535f4a6e6/results">View the Resume Click Test.</a> <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/f71cf38872bb/results">View the Five Second Homepage Impression Test.</a> <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/8d735be63672/results">View the Contact Information Click Test.</a></p>

				<h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
				<p>As far as preliminary planning and research for the site, I found competitor analysis to be very valuable. I was able to grasp the current trends and benchmarks of sleek modern portfolio websites. Many of my design inspirations stemmed from my competitors design choices. This culminated to finalizing features and functionality that I thought would add value to my site and that were evident among my competitors. The feature value matrix for me was more of ranking the importance of what features were absolutely necessary and others that were secondary. Having that resource was valuable especially when I had to pull back on features due to the lack of time. The user interviews weren’t extremely valuable to me. I found that I was trying to reinforce my ideas rather than gather new insight. My own research proved to be much more valuable. </p><br>
				<p>When conducting User Testing it was challenging to extract solid feedback from the users I was testing. It may have been my lack of experience on my part or a poor selection of user participants. Either way, I was not able to gather enough information to make concrete improvements. Many people commented about the monochrome design colors. The feedback was both good and bad. Granted I find the color scheme to best represent my personality and content. As stated above my cognitive walkthroughs were based around very simple tasks. For this reason I was not able to extract any real feedback and it mostly reinforced my decision to place things in certain areas. Lastly, I had trouble with user stories. One issue being that I didn'nt implement all the features I wanted to. The second being I had trouble puttin myself in a users shoes after being involved with the project for so long.</pr><br>
				<p>While I was implementing the site I found time and my technical ability to be a limiting constraint. I was initially very ambitious with what I wanted to accomplish. I did not schedule my time efficiently or break down the work into increments. I had to scrap many of the features that were low on the priority list. This was upsetting as I wanted my portfolio to have fancy features. I focused more on the content, as suggested by the professor, and tried to present in a way that was informative and intuitive.</pr>

			<div class = "incorporation">
				<h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
				<p>There are many things I’d like to change about my portfolio site. To begin, I can add more professional and personal pictures to show my interests and hobbies. I want to include a gallery of pictures in my about me section that exemplify hobbies and interests that I have written in my about me section. From my user testing I found that the home page was confusing to many people. They were not sure what to do with once they had reached it and it lacked a certain purpose. I ended up adding an arrow symbol to nudge users into scrolling down when they land on my site. For now, this arrow is a picture but I am working in JavaScript to make it a button that goes to the following section. Personally, I want to improve the projects and skills section. I would like each project to have it’s own section or separate link to a new page. Furthermore, I would like the individual projects to have pictures, descriptions, and how I utilized my skills with them. For the skills section I wanted to quantify my skills through an information visualization rather than stating I know Java. This was an initial feature I had planned for but did not have the time to implement it. </p><br>
				<p>Overall, I am satisfied with the simple layout and my goals for the future of the site include adding more meaningful JavaScript animations and more specialized content as I narrow down my career aspirations and rack up more project/work experience. Going forward I will continue utilizing a simple and to the point design</p>
